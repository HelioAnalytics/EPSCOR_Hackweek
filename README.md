This series of tutorials is part of the 2022 EPSCOR Hack Week (<a href="https://www.nasawvepscor.org/hack-week/">https://www.nasawvepscor.org/hack-week/</a>) held June 12-17, 2022 on the West Virginia University campus in Morgantown, WV.

These tutorials are made possible through the support of the NASA GSFC Advanced Software Technology Group.  
See their extensive python course materials here:    https://github.com/astg606/py_courses/tree/master/modules

To start, you can take the <a href="https://forms.gle/PTV6xFCA21NYkqfp9">Python Assessment Test</a>

A score of 80% or higher means you may want to skip the "beginner" course material.
