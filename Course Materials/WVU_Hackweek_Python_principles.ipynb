An object is an entity that contains data along with associated metadata and/or functionality. In Python everything is an object, which means everything has some metadata called **attributes** and associated functionality called **methods**. These attributes and methods are accessed via the dot syntax.\n","\n","There are various ways to find/query an objects **attributes** and **methods**\n","\n","* If you have access to the internet the tried and tested method is **Google**, **stackoverflow**, and online manuals/documentation, e.g., the [Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists)\n","    * Python is a well documented language and you can always quickly find out about any object/functionality with a simple Google search\n","* The inline **```dir()```*** in Python will list the **methods**\n","```\n","dir(a)\n","```\n","not very informative, but it does remind you of the names of **attributes** and **methods**\n","* Python introspection package\n","  ```\n","  import inspect\n","  inspect.getmembers(a)\n","  ```\n","* Use the ipython or notebook **TAB completion**:  For our object ```a``` typing ```a.<TAB>``` should show a list of possible completions, move your cursor to the desired one\n","  \n","* Help will also provide a short description of an object/method, ```help(a.append)```"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"ex5I69wnKNWz","outputId":"81e62744-eedf-4cf5-99a2-3cef6c229940","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1648482414067,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":172,"user":{"displayName":"Barbara Thompson","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GiyrmWkq63jcUhl3V9YFvAg8wfKmY0_OFlMi_oK=s64","userId":"17933107283968113791"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Help on list object:\n","\n","class list(object)\n"," |  list(iterable=(), /)\n"," |  \n"," |  Built-in mutable sequence.\n"," |  \n"," |  If no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty list.\n"," |  The argument must be an iterable if specified.\n"," |  \n"," |  Methods defined here:\n"," |  \n"," |  __add__(self, value, /)\n"," |      Return self+value.\n"," |  \n"," |  __contains__(self, key, /)\n"," |      Return key in self.\n"," |  \n"," |  __delitem__(self, key, /)\n"," |      Delete self[key].\n"," |  \n"," |  __eq__(self, value, /)\n"," |      Return self==value.\n"," |  \n"," |  __ge__(self, value, /)\n"," |      Return self>=value.\n"," |  \n"," |  __getattribute__(self, name, /)\n"," |      Return getattr(self, name).\n"," |  \n"," |  __getitem__(...)\n"," |      x.__getitem__(y) <==> x[y]\n"," |  \n"," |  __gt__(self, value, /)\n"," |      Return self>value.\n"," |  \n"," |  __iadd__(self, value, /)\n"," |      Implement self+=value.\n"," |  \n"," |  __imul__(self, value, /)\n"," |      Implement self*=value.\n"," |  \n"," |  __init__(self, /, *args, **kwargs)\n"," |      Initialize self.
