    "\n",
    "Github (code repository): Code repositories are how developers can share and distribute code. Github is a commonly used repository, which is the online counterpart to Git, which is how a user accesses and manages software locally on their own computer. Github facilitates development of code with many contributors, and allows users of the code to receive updates smoothly (usually).  If you want to use software locally, you can \"clone\" a repository. However, if you want to make modifications to the code but do not want it to affect the original, you can \"fork\" the repository. Forking makes a copy that you can edit.\n",
