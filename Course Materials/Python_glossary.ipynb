    "IDE (Integrated Development Environment): An IDE is a collection of tools that allow a user to develop, modify and debug software. What IDE or editing tool you use is a matter of preference. Some facilitate use of code repositories such as Github, while others do not.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Github (code repository): Code repositories are how developers can share and distribute code. Github is a commonly used repository, which is the online counterpart to Git, which is how a user accesses and manages software locally on their own computer. Github facilitates development of code with many contributors, and allows users of the code to receive updates smoothly (usually).  If you want to use software locally, you can \"clone\" a repository. However, if you want to make modifications to the code but do not want it to affect the original, you can \"fork\" the repository. Forking makes a copy that you can edit.\n",
    "\n",
    "API (Application Programming Interface): An API is an example of a very useful resource used by python developers. APIs are intermediaries that facilitate interaction between two different software applications. Python makes use of APIs to send and receive information or data to remote servers, such as Heliophysics data sites.  \n",
